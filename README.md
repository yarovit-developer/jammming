# Jammming App

The jammming app is codeacademy practice project from Front-End Path.

## App Feature Requirements:

* Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account. You will need to follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register your application.

* Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. 

* Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user’s query.

* Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.

* Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.

* Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.

* Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

## Future

**Note: I plan to improve this functionality of the application not much later.
